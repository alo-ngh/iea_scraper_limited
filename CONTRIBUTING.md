# How to contribute

## Setup

To be able to connect to Gitlab from Windows, please follow the instructions
[here](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/02/18/gitlab-dot-com-now-supports-an-alternate-git-plus-ssh-port/).

Then clone the repository on your machine:

```
git clone <project SSHURL>
```

If you have problems to connect with SSHURL:

1. On your computer, [create a private SSH key](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows)
2. [Add a private key to your GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/profile/keys)  
3. Clone the repository on your machine using HTTPS URL
